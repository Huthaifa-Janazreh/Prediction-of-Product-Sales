# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
## Project Overview
As part of my data science bootcamp, this project aims to support a group of homeowners in Ames, Iowa, who are concerned about the declining value of their properties. The goal is to analyze raw housing market data to uncover actionable insights and deliver data-driven recommendations for increasing home value prior to sale.
