# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
## Project Overview
As part of my data science bootcamp, this project aims to support a group of homeowners in Ames, Iowa, who are concerned about the declining value of their properties. The goal is to analyze raw housing market data to uncover actionable insights and deliver data-driven recommendations for increasing home value prior to sale.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the Ames housing dataset
- Identify key features that influence property value
- Build predictive models to estimate home prices
- Deliver practical suggestions for value-boosting renovations or improvements
